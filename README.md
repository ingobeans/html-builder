an online html/css/js editor. it has no server backend, preview window is an iframe and files are stored in localStorage.
there are three keybinds used for navigating the page, being:
  * ctrl+s to save code and update preview window's html
  * ctrl+b to toggle code visibility (in practice toggling fullscreen of the preview window)
  * ctrl+q to reset/clear code

you can also toggle which files/tabs are shown, with the navigation bar at the top left.
